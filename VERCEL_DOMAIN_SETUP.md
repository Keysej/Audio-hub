# Vercel Domain Configuration

## Primary Domain (Use This One)

**Production Domain:** `audio-hub-lyart.vercel.app`

This is your main production domain connected to GitHub. Always use this domain to access your application.

## Why Multiple Domains Exist

Vercel automatically creates multiple domains:
1. **Production Domain** (`audio-hub-ten.vercel.app`) - ✅ **USE THIS ONE**
   - Main production deployment
   - Connected to GitHub main branch
   - This is your primary domain

2. **Preview Domain** (`audio-hub-git-main-jimale-keyses-projects.vercel.app`)
   - Preview deployment for main branch
   - Automatically created by Vercel
   - Can be ignored

3. **Deployment-Specific Domain** (`audio-76jczc9a7-jimale-keyses-projects.vercel.app`)
   - Unique URL for each deployment
   - Automatically created by Vercel
   - Can be ignored

## Solution: Use Only Production Domain

**Always access your app at:** `https://audio-hub-ten.vercel.app`

### To Set This as Primary in Vercel Dashboard:

1. Go to Vercel Dashboard → Your Project (`audio-hub`)
2. Go to **Settings** → **Domains**
3. The production domain `audio-hub-ten.vercel.app` should be listed as "Production"
4. If you want to remove other domains (optional):
   - You can remove preview domains, but they'll be recreated automatically
   - The production domain is the one that matters

### Important Notes:

- **All domains serve the same code** - they're just different URLs
- **Cache issues** - If you see old content, it's likely browser cache, not domain-related
- **Always use the production domain** for sharing/bookmarking

## Clearing Cache After Deployment

After pushing changes, always:
1. Use the production domain: `audio-hub-ten.vercel.app`
2. Hard refresh: `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)
3. Or clear browser cache completely

## Current Status

- ✅ Production domain configured: `audio-hub-ten.vercel.app`
- ✅ GitHub integration enabled
- ✅ Auto-deploy from main branch enabled
